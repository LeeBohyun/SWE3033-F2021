## Introduction

Almost every important computer application must manage, update, and query databases using a database system(s) that best fit its workload. In this course, you will learn the three most popular database systems and their major workloads:

- MySQL and TPC-C (*OLTP workload*)
- RocksDB and YCSB (*Cloud service workload*)
- SQLite and AndroBench (*Mobile workload*)

From these three projects, you can learn how each database system works and understand the characteristics of popular workloads. You can also learn how to measure key (performance-related) metrics and analyze their impacts on performance.
