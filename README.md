# SWE3033: Database Project (Fall 2021)

- Instructor: Prof. Sang-Won Lee (swlee@skku.edu)
- TA: Mijin An (meeeejin@skku.edu)

## Introduction

Almost every important computer application must manage, update, and query databases using a database system(s) that best fit its workload. In this course, you will learn the three most popular database systems and their major workloads:

- MySQL and TPC-C (OLTP workload)
- RocksDB and YCSB (Cloud service workload)
- SQLite and AndroBench (Mobile workload)

From these three projects, you can learn how each database system works and understand the characteristics of popular workloads. You can also learn how to measure key (performance-related) metrics and analyze their impacts on performance.
